## Run locally

1. Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bastien-pruvost/kanap-p5.git
```

2. Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd back
```

3. Install dependencies:

  pnpm install
  # or
  yarn install
  # or
  npm install
```

4. Start Node.js server:

- The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`.

- If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
